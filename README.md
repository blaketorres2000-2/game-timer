# Overview

This project is a simple game timer app that I created to enhance my skills as a software engineer. I aimed to improve my understanding of Swift and SwiftUI while building a useful tool that could help manage game rounds with customizable timers. The app is designed to let users set a countdown timer, start, pause, reset, and stop it as needed. The settings allow the user to adjust the initial timer duration to their preference.

The app has an intuitive user interface with buttons for starting, pausing, and resetting the timer. Once the timer is started, the start button and settings button disappear to prevent issues with restarting. The timer can be paused, resumed, reset, and stopped at any point.

My purpose in creating this app was to improve my proficiency in developing iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI. I wanted to work on managing states, user input, and navigation between screens, all while producing a practical app that I could potentially use in real-world scenarios.

# Development Environment

The app was developed using Xcode on macOS. For source control, I used Git and GitHub to track changes and version my code. 

I used Swift as the programming language with SwiftUI as the UI framework. The app also uses features like `@State` to handle dynamic changes and timers, as well as bindings for passing data between views.

# Future Work

* Add sound or vibration notifications when the timer ends.
* Add an option to set multiple timers and switch between them.
* Improve the settings screen to allow more detailed configuration, such as setting minutes instead of just seconds.
